Subtitle: Auditable Decision Engine

Visual composition:
- Main visual: A technical blueprint schematic showing interconnected decision nodes, each node connected by traced evidence lines leading back to document sources (slides, transcripts). Central focal point is a large "decision verdict" node with radiating verification pathways.
- Layout: Title positioned upper-left with engineering label style, main schematic centered, dimension lines and measurement indicators along borders
- Decorative elements: Grid alignment marks, technical callout boxes showing "Level 2", "±4", "100%", small document icons (PDF, slides) as evidence anchors, dotted trace lines connecting evidence to scores

Color scheme:
- Primary: Engineering Blue (#2563EB), Navy Blue (#1E3A5F)
- Background: Blueprint Off-White (#FAF8F5) with subtle technical grid overlay
- Accent: Amber (#F59E0B) for highlighted verification checkpoints, Light Blue (#BFDBFE) for trace lines

Style notes:
- Precise lines with consistent stroke weights throughout
- Technical schematic aesthetic with dimension annotations
- Clean vector graphics showing the "evidence chain" concept
- Geometric precision for all decision nodes and pathways
- Include measurement/calibration marks suggesting accuracy and auditability
- Overall impression: This is enterprise infrastructure, not a simple scoring tool
